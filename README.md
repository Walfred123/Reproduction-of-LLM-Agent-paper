# Reproduction-of-LLM-Agent-paper
I am a beginner in the field of AI intelligences and reinforcement learning, and I am now studying and trying to reproduce some of the best papers in the field. Because of my limited personal experience and level, I have not successfully implemented the ELLM method. I am sharing some of my personal attempts of the process here.
